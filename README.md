# Crystal Clear Window Cleaning website and price estimator

Hi. You're looking at my **Crystal Clear Window Cleaning** webpage. This is an example of a simple page for a **small business**. The page shows a clear business description, is apropriately coloured and themed and features a simple to use but powerful pricing tool, which allows potential customers to check quickly how much a service might cost them, depending on:
- their Post Code
- the number of windows in their property
- extras chosen
- frequency of service

The page also allows for submission of a potential customer's phone number and extra notes.

##Features

The project features and index homepage, as well as the price estimator page. Both are styled to a clean, glass-reminiscent style, keeping in theme with the business' profession. The pages are simple, easy to read and show interactivity, which is - again - designed to emulate the properties of glass. The /styles directory contains the corresponding .css stylesheets.

The main directory also contains the price-estimator-script.js file, which provides the functionality behind the calculator. 

The /images directory contains the favicon file used on both pages.
